      "She worked with Charles Babbage and his Analytical Engine in the 19th century. She is considered the first programmer because she wrote down an algorithm for use in the Analytical Engine in order to compute the Bernoulli Numbers. She not only created a program, but envisioned capabilities that were not fully realized for another 100 years. Ada, the programming language created by the U.S. Department of Defense is named in her honor.",

      "Grace Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer. At Eckert–Mauchly she began developing the linker. She believed that a programming language based on English was possible. Her linker converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System.",

    "bio":
      "Anita Borg taught herself to program while working at a small insurance company. She earned a Doctorate in Computer Science from New York University in 1981. In 1986, she began working for Digital Equipment Corporation’s Western Research Laboratory, where she developed and patented a method for generating complete address traces for analyzing and designing high-speed memory systems. Her experience running the ever-expanding Systers mailing list, which she founded in 1987, led her to work in email communication. As a consultant engineer in the Network Systems Laboratory, she developed MECCA, an email and Web-based system for communicating in virtual communities. In 1997, soon after starting at Xerox, she founded the Institute for Women and Technology, having previously founded the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in 1994. She passionately believed in working for greater representation of technical women. Her goal was to have 50% representation for women in computing by 2020.",
